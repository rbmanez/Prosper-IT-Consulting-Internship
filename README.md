# Live Pojects

The Tech Academy's Live Projects are made up of four sprints that lasts 2 weeks each. We get to work with a team of fellow developers to enhance an active software project. This allows us to apply the programming skills we learned on practical assignments that mirror actual software development projects while gaining experience working on a software development team.

##### General Process

Each Monday is dedicated to onboarding and sprint planning. We define user stories, divide them into tasks, and set goals for what will be accomplished by the end of the week.

We have daily stand up meetings from Monday through Friday. Each developer discuss what they did the day before, what they will be working on for the current day, and any roadblocks they are running into.

Each Friday we have Sprint Retrospective, which is a quick discussion during the daily stand up that explains what was helpful and what was detrimental to productivity and team work flow. These meetings are meant to improve communication and coordination within the team, including the project manager.

## Conclusion

The Live Projects provided me with an abundance of practical knowledge through my personal experiences and break throughs. Working with a team supplied me the opportunity to learn from others' advice, successes, and setbacks. I gained the confidence to arrive in the middle of large pre-existing projects and collaborate with a team to accomplish our objectives. I grew a deeper understanding for the development and team process and the significance of effective communication.
