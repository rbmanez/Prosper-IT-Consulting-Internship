## Live Project Sprint General Information
#### Live Project Sprint Overview
The Tech Academy's Live Project Sprints ensure students have real-world development experience. The Live Projects are 2-week sprints with 4 iterations, adding up to a total of 8 weeks. Each sprint iteration focuses on specific tasks and technologies.

For 8 weeks, we solely did actual development work that resulted in practical experience. We were challenged to work as part of a team and to figure out new things we weren’t taught. The Live Project Sprints attempts to replicate what it’s like to do the actual job. It prepared us for the actual experience of working on a dev team. This is where all the tools we’ve learned came together.

#### Live Project Sprint Weekly Process
- Each Monday is dedicated to onboarding and sprint planning. We defined user stories, divided them into tasks, and set goals for what will be accomplished by the end of the week.

- We had daily stand up meetings from Monday through Friday through Google Meet. Each developer discussed what we did the day before, what we will be working on for the current day, and any roadblocks we may be experiencing. Outside of the stand up, we also communicated via Slack and email.

- Each Friday we had Sprint Retrospective, which is a quick discussion during the daily stand up that explains what was helpful and what was detrimental to productivity and team work flow. These meetings were meant to improve communication and coordination within the team, including the project manager.

### [Python Live Project Sprint 1](https://github.com/rbmanez/TTA-Live-Project-Sprints/blob/master/PythonLiveProjectSprint1.md)
#### Project Overview
TravelScrape is a web scraping application project built with Django and Beautfiulsoup. With webscraping and API's, the application gathers data from the web that is relevant to the user who will be traveling. It will include weather, flights, events, restaurants, etc.

#### List of Technologies Used
- Python & Django Web Framework
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Amadeus API (used for Airports App)
- Virtualenv (Python Library)
- DevOps (Project Management)
- Git (Source Control)
- Slack (Team Communication)
- Google Meet (Team Meetings)
- VS Code (Code Editor)
  
### [C# Live Project Sprint 2](https://github.com/rbmanez/TTA-Live-Project-Sprints/blob/master/C%23LiveProjectSprint2.md)
#### Project Overview
The Management Portal software is used to manage a collection of jobs. Admins are able to create and distribute a weekly schedule assigning users to certain jobs. Users are able to keep track of which job they are assigned to for the week.

The primary components of this project include the creation of registered users, differentiation between users and admins, creation of "Jobs" with necessary details, adding users to those jobs with an instance of "Schedule" for each user on each job.

The secondary components include a Chat feature (for all users to have a single main chat room for discussion) and Company News (where admins can create announcements for all employees to read).

#### List of Technologies Used
- C# ASP.Net MVC
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Azure DevOps
- Visual Studio 2017
- Git and Team Foundation Server
- Entity Framework 6
- PagedList.Mvc
- Leafletjs
- Leafet Routing Machinge API
- Geolocation API
- Bootstrap 4
- Slack and Google Meet for communications

## Featured User Stories
Below are some featured user stories I completed during the entire 8 week, 4 sprint process to conveniently see here. To see all of the user stories I completed please see the section above, [The Four Live Project Sprints](#the-four-live-project-sprints), and its sub heading links.

For each user story, I answer the following questions:
1. What is the issue?
2. Why is this an issue? (If applicable)
3. How is the issue resolved?
4. What is the end result?

## Conclusion
In the course of 8 weeks, The Live Project Sprints provided me with an abundance of practical knowledge and skills to be a software developer. This is where all the tools we’ve learned came together. I gained the courage to arrive in the middle of a large project and collaborate with a team to accomplish our objectives. I grew a deeper understanding of the development process, workflow, and environment.

#### My Take Away Lessons
- Be comfortable with not knowing something and optimistically accept that fact. No one knows everything. Even the best developers are constantly researching and learning. Remain patient and persistent. Start small and move forward towards a solution.
- Before even coding make sure I know exactly what the user story is requiring and asking. Look around the app and code base and become familiar with the environment. Clarify any doubts. Do some initial research if necessary.
- Break down user stories into manageable steps. Figure out what needs to be done in each step so that I can work, research, and ask more effectively.
- Always think in terms of what the end goal is, what the sub goal is, what I'm currently trying to accomplish and why, and what my code is actually doing.
- Use [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging).
- When in doubt, communicate and clarify.
- Don't be stuck on a problem for too long and ask for help.
- Empathy and kindness are keys to effective relationships and communication, whether it's at work or outside of work.
- Continually learn and improve in terms of work and personal development. It's about progress, not perfection. Enjoy the journey!
