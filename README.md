## Live Project Sprint General Information
The Tech Academy's Live Project Sprints ensure students have real-world development experience. The Live Projects are 2-week sprints with 4 iterations, adding up to a total of 8 weeks. Each sprint iteration focuses on specific tasks and technologies.

For 8 weeks, we solely did actual development work that resulted in practical experience. We were challenged to work as part of a team and to figure out new things we weren’t taught. The Live Project Sprints attempts to replicate what it’s like to do the actual job. It prepared us for the actual experience of working on a dev team. This is where all the tools we’ve learned came together.

#### Process
- Each Monday is dedicated to onboarding and sprint planning. We defined user stories, divided them into tasks, and set goals for what will be accomplished by the end of the week.

- We had daily stand up meetings from Monday through Friday through Google Meet. Each developer discussed what we did the day before, what we will be working on for the current day, and any roadblocks we may be experiencing. Outside of the stand up, we also communicated via Slack and email.

- Each Friday we had Sprint Retrospective, which is a quick discussion during the daily stand up that explains what was helpful and what was detrimental to productivity and team work flow. These meetings were meant to improve communication and coordination within the team, including the project manager.

## Conclusion
The Live Project Sprints provided me with an abundance of practical knowledge and skills to be a software developer. I've become more comfortable with not knowing something, breaking down a task into smaller and manageable steps, and working towards a solution. Working with a team supplied me the opportunity to learn from others' advice, successes, and setbacks. I gained the courage to arrive in the middle of a large project and to collaborate with a team to accomplish our objectives. I grew a deeper understanding for the development process and the significance of constant learning and improvement and effective communication.
#### My Take Away Lessons:
- Be comfortable with not knowing something and optimistically accept that fact. No one knows everything. Even the best developers are constantly researching and learning. Remain patient and persistent. Start small and move forward.
- Before even coding, make sure I know exactly what the user story is asking. Look around the app and code base. Clarify any doubts. Do some initial research if necessary.
- Break down user stories into manageable steps. Figure out exactly what needs to be (or should be) done in each step so that I can work, research, and ask more effectively.
- Comment and take notes often. Afterwards, leave the code a little cleaner than when I arrived.
- Empathy and compassion are the keys to effective relationships, at work and outside of work.
- Constantly learn and improve, in terms of work and life.
