# Live Poject Sprints
The Tech Academy's Live Project Sprints ensure students have real-world development experience. The Live Projects are 2-week sprints with 4 iterations, with each sprint iteration focusing on specific tasks and technologies. We did actual development work that resulted in practical experience. We were challenged to work as part of a team and to figure out new things we weren’t taught. The Live Project Sprints attempts to replicate what it’s like to do the actual job. It prepared us for the actual experience of working on a dev team. This is where all the tools we’ve learned came together. I gained the confidence that I can do the job.

#### The Live Project Sprints cover:
- Working with a team
- Daily stand-ups
- Retrospective and sprint review
- Working in Team Foundation Server
- Checking in and pushing code daily

#### General Process
Each Monday is dedicated to onboarding and sprint planning. We define user stories, divide them into tasks, and set goals for what will be accomplished by the end of the week.

We have daily stand up meetings from Monday through Friday. Each developer discuss what we did the day before, what we will be working on for the current day, and any roadblocks we may be experiencing.

Each Friday we have Sprint Retrospective, which is a quick discussion during the daily stand up that explains what was helpful and what was detrimental to productivity and team work flow. These meetings are meant to improve communication and coordination within the team, including the project manager.

## Conclusion
The Live Project Sprints provided me with confidence and an abundance of practical knowledge and skills to be a software developer. It made me more comfortable being uncomofrtable with not knowing something and working towards a solution. Working with a team supplied me the opportunity to improve myself by learning from others' advice, successes, and setbacks. I gained the courage to arrive in the middle of a large pre-existing project and to collaborate with a team to accomplish our objectives. I grew a deeper understanding for the development and team process and the significance of constant learning and improvement and effective communication.
